Writing for gastalt propmt 

1. Similarity - Brushing would be like zooming into a plot, and similarity would show how 
              nearby points are separated

2. Proximity - Makes brushing a group easier, a group can be easily subset when there is a clear
              separation between points of interest

3. Alignment - Again, makes brushing easier

4. Connectedness - When interacting, it would be easier to see connected points or objects

5. Closure - A closure would be easier to brush, making it easy to subset data

6. Motion - 


Order:
Closure > Proximity > Alignment > Connectedness > Similarity > Motion

I feel this is the most effective as the first few make brushing the data very easy for the
user.
